Write a 2â€“3 page description of a food memory, preferably from your childhood. This could be a memory of tasting for the first time, liking/disliking a particular food, or it could be a memory focused on a particular eating event, collective or individual. Pay attention to as many senses as you can invoke to evoke this memory. Interpret its significance to you personally, as well as for what it might reveal about your enculturation into particular food cultures.
