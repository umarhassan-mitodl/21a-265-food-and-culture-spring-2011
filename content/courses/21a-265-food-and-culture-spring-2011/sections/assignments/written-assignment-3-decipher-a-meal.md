Itemize and decipher a meal, preferably one you've eaten in the previous week, offering a symbolic, structural reading akin to Mary Douglas's. Discuss why this counts as a "meal." This meal might be representative of your daily diet, or an exception to it. We are not being food police here, but rather doing symbolic analyses of empirical data. In your discussion, you must draw on at least 3 other readings, in addition to Douglas. Your paper should be 4â€“5 pages.
