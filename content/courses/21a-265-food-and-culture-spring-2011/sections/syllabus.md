Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Description
-----------

Food is of wide-ranging anthropological interest because, in eating, humans incorporate into our very bodies the products of nature transformed into culture. This course explores connections between what we eat and who we are through cross-cultural study of how personal identities and social groups are formed via food production, preparation, and consumption. Readings are organized around critical discussion of what makes "good" food good (e.g., tasty, healthy, authentic, ethical, etc.). A primary goal of the course is to provide students with theoretical and empirical tools to understand and evaluate food systems at local and global levels.

Classes will combine lecture and discussion. Each class is keyed to a set of readings, and it is crucial that students keep up with the readings and be prepared to discuss them in class. Some lectures will directly engage our readings while others will provide contextualizing historical and theoretical information. Occasionally we will break into small groups for more concentrated discussion. Class participation — regular attendance and participation in discussion — will count strongly towards the final grade.

Requirements
------------

Participation

> You must attend class and participate in discussions. Short in-class written assignments and informal oral presentations may be asked of you throughout the semester. Attendance and participation will account for 15% of the final grade. Use of hand-held electronic devices once class has begun will result in a deduction from your participation grade.

Short Written Assignments

> You will complete 3 short written assignments during the semester as described in the syllabus. The first 2 assignments will each be worth 10% of your final grade; the third assignment will be worth 25% of your final grade. If you anticipate problems handing in work on time, contact me in advance; late written work is reduced by half a grade each day unless an extension has been granted 24 hours prior to due date.

Final Term Paper

> Combining library/online research and analysis, will give you an opportunity to explore in depth central themes of the course. 40% of final grade.
